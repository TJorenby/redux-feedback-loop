# redux-feedback-loop

## Description

_Duration:_Weekend Project

This App is a feedback form (modeled after Prime daily feedback) that allows users to answer questions in the form of "star" ratings as well as comments. In order to progress to the next question, a rating must be confirmed. Users can also return back to previous questions if they wish to change their ratings. Comments are optional. 

After the user has reviewed their responses, they can submit their feedback to the database and are given the option to leave additional feedback. 

In building this app, I practiced skills for full stack integration, connecting a React-powered front-end through a node server to a SQL database. 

This app features...
    - React
    - Node
    - Express
    - Redux
    - Postgres

Components were styled using...
    - SASS
    - Ant Design
    - React-Icons (Font Awesome)
    - Material UI
